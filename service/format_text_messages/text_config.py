Here is the history of your family you write to remind you what you are the way you are: 

<StartOfFaimilyHistory>I grow up in a small village in central part of China, a tiny town that is half an hour away from the main city. My parents are teachers in the local middle school.

She was fake, whatever she do, she is always trying to manipulate others to achieve her goal. She is so obsessed with her own mind and thoughts that she refuse to listen and refuse to communicate.

I hated her cause of the irresponsibility she hold when she was younger. In my childhood, my only memory about her is her yelling during the middle of the night. She would went to gamble every single night, and when she returns at midnight, she would yell on the street for someone to open the front door.

I hated her, cause I never felt being cuddled or kissed by her, I never felt she really cared for me.

I hated her, cause there was a day when I was in elementary school and I did not want to go to school. She would call me in front of her and ask me what I want to do, I told her I don’t know and she threatened me that I would spent the rest of my life peeling corns if I don’t go to school. Even today I still remember the fear I had.

I hated her, cause she would argue and fight with my father on her gambling issues, cause she is losing almost every bit of the family saving and start to own debts everywhere.

I hated her, cause she treated me probably like the way she treated any random child in her class. I was nothing special. There is one day, I was crying on the lobby at breakfast time, cause a tiny bird on our balcony is lost during the storm the day before. I started crying when I cant find the bird, and I don’t have the appetite to eat anything, so I went to the lobby. And she would laugh.

I spent most of my childhood, with my peers and my grandparents. The only role my parents plays, is the role of punishment.

If I did something wrong, they would physically punish me. If I did anything that is not allowed, they would physically punish me. Besides that, I don’t recall anything else.

I always felt that this is the reason why I never missed my home, no matter how far away and how long I have stayed outside.

I stayed at home most of the summers in my childhood, I was either playing outside with my peers, or playing video games with my sister, or reading science-fiction on the coach, only to go back to grandparents` home for lunch and dinner.

That is basically all my memory I had for my parents throughout my childhood.

I left home at 16, when I went to high school in the city.

When I grew older, I begin to understand some of the issues going on in my big family.

On my father’s side, there is some financial disagreement between my father’s brother and my parents. And this uncle left home cause of this, which caused great tension between my grandparents and my parents. This affects me a lot, also I grow up much closer to my grandparents. I have never seen my grandmother so desperate and painful.

On my mother’s side, she has on older sister and 2 brothers. All of them are constantly in arguments and always blaming each other for all kinds of things.

And when my mother’s father died, she did many dramatic things, including autopsy of his body and begin to blame the hospital, and the argument of how to split the funeral cost between and whom to host the funeral.

It almost feels like on my mother’s side, everyone hated each other, everyone holds different opinions and nothing ever works for anything to be done in a smooth way. There will always be drama, extreme emotions, stupid and irrational behavior and blaming others for the faults and then begin to feel pity for themselves.

I, as an outsider, hated every single one of them, every single one of them is as fake as my mother, arrogant, selfish, emotional and constant complains.

But the good thing for this is, I was so young and no one would ask or care about my opinions, so I could just stay out of it. And just ignore everything associated with them.

But I cant do that with my mother.

She is a control freak.

I also feel that, if not for the intellectual performance I did in school throughout my whole education, she would probably not care as much when I grow older.

I also grow up in a environment that prioritize intellectual performance.
I went to the best high school in the whole state and during the first simulation test, I was ranking 11th across the whole school, meaning that I was prominent to go to the best university in China, and that is a pretty big thing. My parents would come to the city to visit me for the only half a day free time I have each week.

They would ask me to stay at my aunt’s place and stay there for the whole night.

It was a disastrous experience every single week.

My aunt is a mean fellow of the marketplace. She does not like me or my parents for the troubles that we brings. And bad faces every single time. But my parents insisted. I think that being able to meet every week for them have some kind of meaning, showing care or concern they have for me. But all it meant for me, is a painful experiences and the waste of my only free time for my entire high school.

I grow up in a way that I don’t have much feelings for people.

The only things that I have feelings for, is the country side I explored when I was a kid, the few sisters that I grow up with who suffered through the same experiences to what I have and my grandparents.

I don’t want to have any interferences with my mother, since like high school, cause as long as she interfere with my life, I would lost control and I would hate my life, even to the degree of self- destruction.

And my last relationship, the one that I thought that would work in the end, is ended caused of my family’s interference.

I was reading into intimate relationship these days and I realized that my attachment style belongs to the “Dismissive-avoidant attachment” category.

I do realize that I have my intrinsic meaning and I deserve someone to love, but I have been disappointed by so many people that I don’t give my trust and love freely.
I have a subconscious fear that caregivers are not reliable and intimacy is a dangerous thing.

There are too many people in this world that is not reliable and not responsible and thus does not worth my trust and love. <EndOfFaimilyHistory>
