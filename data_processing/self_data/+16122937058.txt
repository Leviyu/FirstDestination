Hey, how's your foot feeling? Are you planning on going to tennis tomorrow evening? I saw they moved the start time up to 6 PM, which I probably can't quite make, but I'm hoping I can get there ~6:15-6:30 PM, in case you're interested.

Oct 05, 2021  2:43:04 PM
Me
Feeling good, thanks for checking. I am planning to go as well. Just drop by when you come. We can team up and kick some ass, or get kicked.

Oct 05, 2021  6:08:24 PM (Read by you after 2 minutes, 47 seconds)
+16122937058
Great to hear! See you there.

Oct 13, 2021 12:54:25 PM (Read by you after 2 minutes, 5 seconds)
+16122937058
Hi! FYI, I'm on the wait-list for tonight, since I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to come tonight (I had a piece of furniture being delivered with a very wide delivery window, but it arrived already!). I have your tennis balls from last week, though, so I can drop those off regardless (or I could drop them off somewhere earlier, since I won't be able to arrive until ~6:30 again). Let me know what works for you!

Oct 13, 2021 12:56:07 PM (Read by you after 23 seconds)
+16122937058
Also, I hope your knee wasn't too bad after last week! I'm worried I'm bad luck for you--two injuries since I started coming :(.

Oct 13, 2021  1:01:25 PM
Me
Haha not at all, technically not injury, I used to play soccer a lot and had a few really bad ones. I registered but I have something come on today actually, so I would not be going today. So you should go! The waitlist is just to make sure the court is not resource constrained I think. Don't worry about it.

Oct 13, 2021  1:20:42 PM (Read by you after 13 seconds)
+16122937058
Glad to hear about the knee! Sorry to miss you tonight, and hope to catch you next week! Do you want your tennis balls back before then, or should I just hold on to them?

Oct 13, 2021  1:21:44 PM
Me
Nah just hold it. My week is pretty packed so I have no use for it at all.

Oct 13, 2021  1:23:20 PM (Read by you after 8 seconds)

Alright; well, have a good evening and week!

Hey David, are you going today? Last time they talked about migrating to another court, is it still at Corona Del sol?

Oct 20, 2021  3:09:34 PM (Read by you after 13 minutes, 59 seconds)
+16122937058
Yeah, I'm planning to go (though, again, likely can't arrive until ~6:30 PM), and yes, still at Corona del Sol

Oct 20, 2021  3:10:16 PM (Read by you after 13 minutes, 17 seconds)
+16122937058
My understanding is there's a *different* set of courts that closed, so John was advising there might be more competition for these courts

Oct 20, 2021  3:17:52 PM (Read by you after 5 minutes, 41 seconds)
+16122937058
After a full set of doubles last week with folks around my skill level (2.5-3?), someone who I'd estimate is probably a 4.5+ came and hit against me for a while--that was quite a workout/beating :).

Oct 20, 2021  3:25:20 PM

üòÇ Gocha, I will the beating later than.

Hi! Would the evening of Saturday, 10/30 work for you for tennis?

Oct 21, 2021 12:12:35 PM

Sure nothing planned so far. Let's say 7pm? I can reverse a court.

Oct 21, 2021 12:40:50 PM (Read by you after 30 seconds)
+16122937058
7 PM should work for me. How/where do you reserve a court? (Other than paid indoor courts, I'm only familiar with first-come-first-serve stuff like the Wednesday night tennis situation.)

Oct 21, 2021 12:41:43 PM
Me
My local gym lifetime has empty slots.

Oct 21, 2021 12:53:39 PM (Read by you after 11 minutes, 53 seconds)
+16122937058
Ah, cool, though is that going to cost a bunch of money (to reserve a court and/or allow me access as a non-member)? And are you able to make sure it's an outdoor court, for maximum COVID safety (in case they have both indoor and outdoor)?

Oct 21, 2021  1:06:05 PM
Me
It's outdoor, and it is free. I Gocha brother.

Oct 21, 2021  1:09:32 PM (Read by you after 24 minutes, 33 seconds)

Ooh, that sounds annoying; sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to get it worked out. I've been out of commission for a bit, too: our childcare provider was out with COVID a couple weeks, so I was doing childcare+work all day, then more work until 10:30 PM every night to catch up.

I'll have to check with my wife, but would you potentially be interested in tonight ~7:45 PM?

I'm doing fine. My morning work meetings have gotten an hour earlier since DST started, which is annoying, but I'll survive. We discovered Perch Brewery, and really enjoyed that last weekend. In-laws were in town for 4 days recently; they're nice enough, but it's still somewhat disruptive/stressful.

We actually had a large outrage on the time change, lol. I did a circle back from Vegas, Death Valley and Joshua tree, almost 5days, havnt camped for a while so a few days in a row in a rough condition is pretty insane. Got prob 4h of sleep each day. ü§¶üèª

We're thinking about going up to Payson Sunday or Monday. Would you be interested in hiking Barnhardt Trail with my son (on my back) and me? https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/arizona/barnhardt-trail

Hey that sounds great! Let me know the plan when you figure It out.

I think it makes sense to try to hit the road when my son's ready for his first nap of the day--usually around 9 AM; does that work for you? I'd be happy to drive you, if you want to be at my house around that time, and are willing to wear a mask while we're in the car.

Sounds good, I will drop by around 9.

+16122937058
I did, thank you! I'm sorry for the super slow response--it's been quite a ~week+. My grandmother got put on hospice care, so I traveled to MN to see her, in case she dies soon. Then my son and wife got COVID-19, so I had to take care of him/them (because our nanny won't come to COVID house), then I got COVID, etc... And today I had to start work at 4 AM to align schedules with two teams on three continents because my project is late and CEO is angry.

Ah damn, ü§¶üèª. Health and safety is priority, hope everything works out soon. 
Sometimes stuff just get super busy, take a step back to relax and focus on the priority. 
If you are up to chat or grab a drink or something, let me know.

How are you holding up?

Jun 16, 2022  9:00:01 PM (Read by you after 26 minutes)
+16122937058
It's been a long, exhausting week, but we made a lot of progress at work (including me dusting off my engineering hat and directly contributing multiple fixes), so at least that's satisfying. Our nanny also had a death in the family, so was out today, meaning I had to watch my son, too.

At least I never got bad COVID symptoms!

How are you?

Jun 16, 2022  9:29:50 PM
Me
That's good to hear! 
Covid vaccine even almost killed me. ü´†
It's crazy to think about COVID are still going when there's literally no one wearing masks now on the street. 
I am doing great, work is chill and trying to get back to lifting.

Jun 22, 2022  6:57:16 PM

How is it going!? Still hanging in there?! ü§¶üèª

+16122937058
Hey! It's going alright. We're all recovered from COVID-19, and my son even got his first vaccine dose yesterday! But he's been waking us up in the middle of the night all week, so we're exhausted.

How are you? Been lifting?

Jun 23, 2022 10:15:24 PM

Ouiiii, that's awesome! A big step.

Jun 30, 2022  3:50:12 PM

For sure, I am free on Saturday, tennis sounds great, drinks is awesome as well, any preferred time?

Jun 30, 2022  4:34:15 PM (Read by you after 3 seconds)
+16122937058
Considering the weather and my son's schedule, probably either the morning (~7/8 AM?) or ~8:45 PM. I'd rather not play tennis in direct sunlight at 100+ F.

Jun 30, 2022  4:36:17 PM

Right, golden pineapple has some late night cocktails that are pretty good. Wanna do that? Fine with any other options as well.

We can just go to golden pineapple directly.

Jul 02, 2022  7:15:22 PM (Read by you after 29 minutes, 7 seconds)
+16122937058
I did, but my son didn't get enough nap time today, so we put him to bed already. I can do any time now, but it's also fine if you still want to do 8:45.

Jul 02, 2022  7:44:38 PM

Yeah let's do that.

Jul 02, 2022  7:54:05 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 54 seconds)

Hey what up Davaid, how is everything! Sorry I haven't been in touch for a while. I had a two week break and work has been pretty hectic.

Aug 28, 2022  4:42:39 PM (Read by you after 7 minutes, 58 seconds)
+16122937058
No worries; I'm guilty, too. But great minds think alike: we were driving back from Sedona today and talked about texting you this evening after we got back!

I've been a bit under the weather for a couple weeks--my son brings illnesses home from daycare constantly now--but otherwise good. My very late project at work is almost complete, finally. They might even let me hire people to replace the contractors in Bulgaria after this (though not holding my breath).

What did you do with your break?

Aug 28, 2022  4:57:42 PM
Me
Yo, sounds like a lot of stuff happened. I somewhere get interested in black Jack and decided to learn card counting and went to Vegas and ended up losing 2 grands. :( but the rest of it was fun, stayed in San Diego for a few days and visited a few friends. 
Hey let me know when you are free next week, let's go get some drink/s.

Sep 08, 2022  6:20:26 PM
+16122937058
Hey! Are you free at all this weekend? I'm pretty flexible aside from Sunday morning through early afternoon.

The trip itself was nice--good weather, got to play some tennis--but air travel with a young child is something I'm not eager to repeat.

No worries! My time is quite flexible. Whatever works for you. A quick drink is fine as well. I am open tomorrow after work, wanna do that?

It's okay; you've put up with plenty of my tardiness, so you've earned a pass ;). And yeah, I can do tomorrow night. Does 8:30 work for you, or want 9 again?
