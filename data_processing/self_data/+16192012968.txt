Hey Henry. What times/days would be best for you for tennis?

Mar 14, 2018 10:47:39 PM
Me
Monday and Thursday usually works best for me. Time is flexible. Ideally would be around 6:30pm.

Mar 14, 2018 10:47:51 PM

Any time works for you?

Mar 15, 2018  8:39:08 AM (Read by you after 8 seconds)
+16192012968
Tuesday and Thursday I have class until 7:30pm. Possibly Monday since my class gets out at 6pm.

Mar 15, 2018  8:47:56 AM
Me
Damn, Monday is good. I kinda want to try twice per week and let's talk about that next time we meet then. Also there are several places for practice, the closest is on rural near ASU but it is often occupied on a busy day. There is some better places we can also check but it is further. Also let me know if you need a drive.

Mar 15, 2018  8:59:49 AM (Read by you after 3 seconds)
+16192012968
Sounds good. I have a bike so depending how far it is I'll be ok. Also, I will ask Ilze tomorrow in class if she knows about other places to practice, she's the one that plays tennis.

Mar 15, 2018  9:00:50 AM
Me
For sure, at some point we can invite her to coach us. :D

Mar 15, 2018  9:05:02 AM

So let's meet on Monday and get it going then!

For sure, why not.

Mar 19, 2018 10:23:17 AM

Cool. Do you have tennis balls as well?

Mar 19, 2018 10:23:42 AM

Yep, just bring some water and good shoes and we are good to go.

Mar 19, 2018 10:25:00 AM

Hey. I've got some work to finish up later so I was thinking maybe something close like Brick and Barely. Then we can find another place next time.

Mar 23, 2018  4:54:45 PM

Sure, that is actually very close to my place.

Mar 23, 2018  4:55:14 PM

Hey Henry. Would you be up to play tennis later today, maybe around 5?

Mar 31, 2018  8:40:07 AM

Sure, how about the high school on baseline and McClintock, we can check out that place.

Hey Henry. So the tickets I got for the race came with a VIP experience where we can meet the drivers and get a private tour inside the track. The catch is we have to be there by 1pm. Would you want to do that?

Apr 04, 2018  3:59:44 PM

Damn, you are already there! I have not been to Ireland before but according to my understanding with my Irish colleague, they are tough people with soft heart! üòÇ sure you will enjoy it. I just finished one paper and am working on the last project for my dissertation. Good Ol' summer time.

Just got one paper submitted and this semester would mostly work on my dissertation, so not too bad! Just wanna check with you to see if we wanna get some sports schedule going, if you are too busy for the first week or so with the school stuff, it is all good. But I would like to get it going, kick some balls and drink some beer. :p

Oh nice. I'm sure that's still plenty of work. I don't think my classes will be as hectic but they are spread out and I'll have to be on campus 10-11 hours a day. I'd be up to play occasionally but don't think I can commit to anything long term. But if you just want to grab a beer I'm open to that, especially on the weekends.

Definitely no commitment, we do it for fun. And sure, beer on weekends, there are a couple nice places that you probably have not been to yet, let's find a time to check it out.

Hey Henry. I'd definitely be up to grab a beer. I haven't been to Moore's but it looks pretty cool. What day were you thinking?

Aug 27, 2018  5:54:20 PM

How about Tomorrow or Thursday, if it doesn't work for you, we can do weekends too.

Aug 27, 2018  5:55:53 PM (Read by you after 43 minutes, 22 seconds)

Either day works for me. I get out of class around 6pm. Do you want to go around then?

Side note, would you and your roommate (Mike?) he interested in doing an escape room this weekend?

I would prefer 6pm, feels right. Shall we do that?

Hey Henry. Send it to dvonlich@asu.edu

I just stopped by the printing lab and they said as long as you supply the material there's no cost to print it and the turn around time is like 1-2 weeks, possibly sooner.

+16192012968
Hey Henry. I was talking to some friends about your model and I think you might be possible to 3D print it, but it would depend on the printer and there will be a decent amount of work you would have to do to it after it's printed.

Dec 12, 2018  2:43:11 PM
Me
I am ready to try, whatever it takes! Just let me know how. Thanks for helping too!

Dec 12, 2018  2:47:04 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 55 seconds)
+16192012968
No worries. So I'm not familiar with the program that the model is in, but if there was a way to split the sphere in half, that might be the best way to print it. Ideally, when you print you want to have a flat surface at the bottom and then you could glue the two pieces together. Do you think that would be possible?

Dec 12, 2018  2:50:45 PM
Me
I can provide whatever format that is easier if that is the case. And yes, I can divide them into half, or add some kind of bottom structure to it.

Dec 12, 2018  3:03:53 PM (Read by you after 6 minutes, 23 seconds)
+16192012968
I thought about a support as well, but my main concern is the parts that come off the sphere and thinking about how they would get printed. Actually, I'll be on campus again in the next couple days and I can just ask someone at the lab since they know the printers capabilities better.

Dec 12, 2018  3:10:43 PM

Aren't you supposed to wear a mask or something in the lab?

Jan 06, 2019  3:00:01 PM

I usually do but it was another team working on stuff and they didn't turn the vent on until the whole shop was filled.

One gal in our group almost exploded the whole lab during hydrogen loading experiment. Kinda reminded how dangerous it could be.

Oh wow. It wasn't anything that crazy. They were doing stuff with carbon fiber, I think. It's just like a throbbing headache that hasn't gone away

I see. If you have ginger, try ginger tea. It helps. Basically boiled water, ginger and honey.

My print filament just arrived today. One more question, if I divide the model into half. Should it be solid inside? Do I have to fill it? Do I care about whatever is in the sphere?

This is my precious one, it is solid inside. Which makes it hard to connect with the other half.

Jan 10, 2019 10:37:23 AM (Read by you after 50 minutes, 23 seconds)
+16192012968
The printer should have an option that allows you to choose if the middle is solid or partially filled. Since it needs some kind of structure to support itself while it prints it can't be hollow, but there should be options that use less filament, something like a honeycomb design.

Hey Hongyu! How's your week going? You still up to hang out this weekend?

Nov 21, 2019  8:00:14 PM
Me
For sure! My friend is gonna host a fancy French dinner on Sunday, and watch a 90s movie after. If you are up to we can do it, otherwise let's go grab beer.

Hey Devon, I usually do early swimming and then hot sauna at the gym on Saturday morning, just checking if you are interested.

Hey Hongyu! Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, but I'm out of town for the weekend. I've been thinking about you. We should catch up one of these days.

Hey Hongyu! My phone quit working the other week and I finally just got a new one. I'm doing ok, finishing up finals this week. How are you?

May 06, 2020  1:38:26 PM
Me
I see, I am actually doing great! The solitary life really clears mind and allows me to actually start reading again. Any progress on the book I sent ya? Would love to hear your opinion.

May 06, 2020  1:59:51 PM (Read by you after 25 minutes, 46 seconds)
+16192012968
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that. I haven't been able to read much or do much of anything lately unfortunately. All of my classes have added a significant amount of work since switching over to online so I've been even more swamped than usual, but my last final is Thursday so I'm looking forward to reading more and relaxing then.

May 06, 2020  2:28:52 PM
Me
GL with the final, I can't believe it is may already. I am also taking online as well, lots of fun, and most of the time I would try to avoid the homework, there are just so many, would try to discipline and do the homework as I go.

May 07, 2020  9:21:26 AM (Read by you after 5 minutes, 5 seconds)

Thanks! That sounds fun. What online class are you taking?

May 07, 2020  9:27:35 AM

Mostly on architecture of different deep neural nets, NLP and computer vision. Also started a Spanish lesson as well.

I prob need to review some statistics very soon as it is getting rusty as hell.

+16192012968
Sounds like you're definitely keeping busy. I would offer to help but I feel like I haven't actually learned anything in statistics haha

May 07, 2020 11:36:37 AM
Me
I never really learnt statistics either, they have a half life of 3month probably. But the thing is, this is something you can't google to find an answer. So when I need it, I just have to read it again. Feels bad man, third time in 2 years.

May 07, 2020  4:29:38 PM (Read by you after 47 minutes, 11 seconds)
+16192012968
Haha that sounds about right. This is one of the few classes where I really felt like I haven't learned much of anything. It's good you're working to refresh yourself

Huuuum, a bit bored, other than that it is going good. What's going on for you!?

Jul 26, 2020 12:52:25 PM (Read by you after 18 seconds)
+16192012968
Yeah I feel you on that. Not much going on for me. I've been back and forth between Florida and California a few times. Starting to get ready for classes to start again next month. How is work going for you?

Jul 26, 2020 12:56:45 PM
Me
Traveling must be horrible nowadays. My biggest complain is probably that the gym that I used to go to is closed, feeling the back pain üòû. Work is going smooth, my team is very small and everyone is being supportive and chill. Career wise I feel I did not make much progress, which is always burning on the back of my mind.

Jul 26, 2020 12:57:17 PM
Me
For school would it all be online?

Jul 26, 2020  1:00:06 PM (Read by you after 11 seconds)
+16192012968
Traveling hasn't been too bad, but not being home for so long and sleeping on couches gets a little old. Yeah, not having access to a gym has been rough too.That's good work is going smoothly, but a bummer you're questioning your choice. Have you been looking at other options?

Jul 26, 2020  1:01:08 PM
+16192012968
Unfortunately, most of my classes are still going to be in person. I mean I prefer that over online because of how poorly the professors have been handling the transition, but it's concerning how being around that many people everyday is going to work

Jul 26, 2020  1:01:48 PM

Dang, consider AZ is now the highest daily increase, that is rough.
