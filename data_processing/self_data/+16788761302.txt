Was wondering if I have to take 9 ft cargo van or 10 ft truck. Also, do I have to buy insurance?

May 30, 2016  3:50:02 PM

I've no idea of the size. You do need insurance though, just a few bucks.

Shule said he could do it ... if he can't be ready by 2:40, you could perhaps drive ...

Then let him do it. He will always be prepared as long as you tell him the deadline. :P

Hey Hongyu! Hope all's well at CIDER! I wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind if I got a small package shipped to Santa Barbara to bring it to Tempe. It's bcuz of temperature issues as you know it's still pretty hot in Tempe. Let me know! Thanks!

Yeah sure, I can mail it or bring it back depends on you, let me know the detail.

It's going to be shipped from abroad so it might take 2 weeks to get there - right in time for you to bring it back I think! I will let you know when it gets shipped. Thanks much!

Also it's going to be a small package - you can bring it as is - just keep it away from heat and sun!

Hi Hongyu, could you please check for the package today or tomorrow? I put your name on it and sent it to the kohn hall and it might have arrived ... let me know if you find out. Thanks much!

+16788761302
It just needs to be kept away from heat/sun ... So if you have it at home and it's easier to bring to office, that's fine. 
Has the package arrived yet?

I gonna bring it to the office then, it had arrived, I will be back around July 25th.

Thanks for picking it up, Hongyu! If you are all driving back could make sure it's not in the sun?
I hope it's not too big in size - it shouldn't be!

Hello Hongyu! Shule is leaving now and I am still waiting for the bus at groceries so I might not make it by 11:30. I suggest you should just go whenever you want to.
Thank you very much for offering the ride again!
