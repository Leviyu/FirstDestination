Is your family in China ok?  I‚Äôm in New York and working in a lab at the hospital here. It‚Äôs one of the largest hospitals in the country. I‚Äôm seeing covid patients everyday. The cases are increasing and people are dying. It‚Äôs insane.

My hometown stopped the lockdown since last week, so ppl are getting out now, but new York is definitely get into the news everyday.

I have a couple friends worked in the hospital back home so I know how bad it is. What about you, not the best time to go back to New York hum.

Not at all man. Most of the patients in our hospital who have the virus are elderly and were already sick but some of the employees have contracted it as well.

Mar 27, 2020  3:59:33 PM
+15856233756
Just be careful. I have seen the dying patients. My bro is an MD here and he has seen it too. It‚Äôs no joke. Young people get it and die from it too.  Are you working from home?

The best tips I got from my friends are, don‚Äôt touch your face and wash them carefully. Like seriously.

Also since you work in a hospital, take very precaution.

+15856233756
We always do. Those are good tips. It‚Äôs difficult because you touch your face 2,000 to 3,000 times a day. The most important thing is to wash your hands as much as possible.

Hand sanitizer can help but it‚Äôs ineffective against viruses

That‚Äôs why they use medical alcohol
